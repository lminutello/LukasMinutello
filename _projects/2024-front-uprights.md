The front uprights are the main connection point for unsprung components on a car. The upright must conform to the suspension geometry and clearances must be taken into account. Load cases were aquired from wheel force transducer testing and used in ANSYS. Material was added and removed according to the results. This year the design was particularly challenging due to significant changes in the suspension geometry that lead to tigher clearances with the brake rotors, and thus less material in certain places. Overall, the design was a success, with no failures at competition. Weight can be reduced further in the future.
